# LIZARDS MUST DIE

This is a rogue-like game developed as a part of my programming course assignment. The game aims to provide an exciting and challenging gameplay experience inspired by classic rogue-like games like The Binging of Isaac.

## Overview

The objective of the game is to navigate through a dungeon filled with lizards, treasures, and various obstacles. As a player, you will control a character who explores the dungeon in search of valuable items and tries to kill the main threat to ancient Russia - Lizards Leader.

## Features

- Permadeath: Once the player's character dies, the game ends, and a new dungeon is generated for the next playthrough.
- Enemies and combat: Encounter dangerous foes throughout the dungeon and engage in tactical combat.
- Loot: Discover and collect powerful items to enhance your character's abilities.
